# File-Based-Key-Value-Data-Store

# Project Description

A key-value data store is a data storage paradigm for storing, retrieving and managing the associative data. In order to implement this, a file-based key-value data store meant to be used as a local storage for one single process on one laptop is developed. The key-valued data is created in JSON. It supports basic functionalities like Create, Read, Delete (CRD). If create is invoked for an existing file, an error message is displayed. New key-value pairs can be appended to the file. Read & delete option can be performed by providing a key by the user. Every key supports Time To Live property and it is optional for the user to use it. Appropriate error/warning messages are displayed if the datastore breached any limits.
